Project Abstract

RNATPH is a high-performance computational biological designed to infer cellular dynamics from single-cell RNA sequencing data. It leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of RNA velocity by embedding the fundamental kinetic equations of transcription directly into a deep learning architecture.
